# Focuser

**Ditch those ugly focus styles and use Focuser! A stylable, traveling focus indicator.**

Focuser is a script for enhancing the accessibility of a page by adding a traveling focus indicator that can sit above other elements and not be affected by local element styling.

More details are coming soon...
